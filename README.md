# üñ•Ô∏èüí° Vintage Visionary

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site is a nostalgic throwback to the early days of the internet, designed with the aesthetic of the mid-90s web. With retro fonts, gifs and a classic layout, this site captures the charm of the early web era, offering a glimpse into the personal and professional aspects of my journey.

## üé® Features:
* Classic 1996 Design: Inspired by the simple and iconic designs of the '90s, this website uses elements such as bright backgrounds, animated GIFs, and text-based navigation that recall the charm of early web pages.
  
* Responsive Layout: While we‚Äôre celebrating the past, I‚Äôve made sure the site works well on modern devices, with simple CSS that ensures a smooth viewing experience on both desktop and mobile.

* Skills Showcase: A dedicated section highlighting my technical skills in HTML and CSS, presented in a fun and nostalgic way.

* Vintage Touch: The site includes elements like old-school "Guestbook" features (using modern methods) and simple image animations, reminiscent of early web designs.

## üåü Purpose:
This website was created for fun and as a way to travel through creativity. It‚Äôs a tribute to the early internet era, when websites were simple, colorful, and full of personality. The design captures the spirit of the 1990s web, featuring elements like pixelated fonts, animated GIFs, and basic HTML layouts.

Through this project, I aim to offer an experience that is both a nostalgic trip for those who remember the early days of the web and a creative playground for those exploring web design today. Whether you are a fellow developer or simply a visitor, I hope this site sparks some joy and inspiration!
