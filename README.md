# Vintage Visionary

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site is a nostalgic throwback to the early days of the internet, designed with the aesthetic of the mid-90s web. With retro fonts, gifs and a classic layout, this site captures the charm of the early web era, offering a glimpse into the personal and professional aspects of my journey.

## Features:
* Classic 1996 Design: Inspired by the simple and iconic designs of the '90s, this website uses elements such as bright backgrounds, animated GIFs, and text-based navigation that recall the charm of early web pages.
  
* Responsive Layout: While we’re celebrating the past, I’ve made sure the site works well on modern devices, with simple CSS that ensures a smooth viewing experience on both desktop and mobile.

* Skills Showcase: A dedicated section highlighting my technical skills in HTML and CSS, presented in a fun and nostalgic way.

* Vintage Touch: The site includes elements like old-school "Guestbook" features (using modern methods) and simple image animations, reminiscent of early web designs.

## Technologies Used:

* HTML: The backbone of the website, using basic, clean HTML for structure.

* CSS: Styled using simple CSS, with retro design choices like pixelated fonts, vivid colors, and glowing text effects.
  
* Images and GIFs: All images and animated GIFs are chosen to reflect the fun, quirky vibe of 1990s web culture.

## How to View:
This portfolio is best viewed in a modern browser for full compatibility with HTML5 and CSS3 standards, but it also has a nostalgic touch with elements that resemble older web pages. Make sure to enable images and be ready for a trip down memory lane with those animated GIFs!
